This repository represents the authoritative source for the Offline-First, Environment-Adaptive Music Identification Application. The product vision, principles, and non-negotiables are defined by the Product Definition Document (PDD).

## Product Vision

This application exists to identify music in the real world — not ideal conditions.

It is designed to work when:

* Connectivity is unavailable or unreliable
* Audio environments are noisy and imperfect
* Users cannot capture audio at the perfect moment

If it fails in clubs, festivals, bars, or similar environments, it fails as a product.

---

## Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

* **Offline-first by default** — audio capture must function without connectivity
* **Environment-adaptive** — the app adjusts to noise and conditions, not the user
* **Failure is informative** — unsuccessful identifications feed improvement loops
* **User trust first** — consent-driven audio, location, and data handling

These principles are binding across all implementations and contributions.

---

## Key Capabilities (Conceptual)

* Local audio snippet capture with secure on-device storage
* Adaptive snippet length optimized for noisy environments
* Deferred identification when offline, with user confirmation upon reconnection
* Timestamping and optional geolocation for contextual recall
* Optional user submission of failed snippets (anonymous or attributed)
* First-time onboarding tutorial focused on real-world usage

## Repository Structure (Initial)

```
/README.md              → This document
/docs/                  → Product documents (PDD, diagrams, decisions)
/frontend/              → Mobile app (future)
/backend/               → Identification & processing services (future)
/research/              → Audio experiments, notes, datasets (future)
/.github/               → Contribution & governance files
```

At this stage, the repository is documentation-first by design.

---

## Governance & Contributions

* The Founder retains final decision authority on scope, features, and direction
* Contributions must align with the Product Definition Document
* No audio data or user data may be introduced without explicit consent mechanisms

Detailed contribution guidelines will be added prior to accepting external contributors.

## Roadmap (High-Level)

1. Documentation & ownership locking (current)
2. Technical feasibility validation
3. Prototype architecture
4. Controlled MVP development
5. Funding / partnership discussions
